      <h1>The Fitness Journey</h1>

    <h2><em>A journey through fitness</em></h2>
    <h3>You may be wondering, "What should I do to begin this journey? How might I achieve the goals I set out to achieve?" Below is a brief list of what I believe needs to be done in order to be successful in your fitness endeavors:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>A primary and important factor in achieving a healthy and strong body is discipline. You must remain disciplined and consistent in your efforts. Without consistency physical improvement will be limited.</li>
      <li>Learning proper and healthy movement patterns is essential for long term benefits. Always remain in a good postural position and don't lift beyond your bodys current capacity.  Doing so is sometimes called "ego" lifting. This is detrimental to your body in the long term due to the increased likelihood of injury.</li>
      <li>Knowing what particular diet to implement is important for optimal gain. Depending on what you're trying to accomplish on your fitness journey you may need to consume greater or lesser quantities of food and a variety of different types of food.</li>
    
      <li>It is most important to move your body consistently. If not on a daily basis several times a week. Without this consistent effort you will experience minimal benefits. Something I've found to be essential in my own journey is eliminating the aspect of mind that tells you you're too tired, too cold, too uncomfortable. The aspect of mind that pushes against you and your progress. If you can overcome this you can achieve a great and powerful body and mind.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="GoodStuff">
      <p>Although I could certainly put more on this list I think this is adequate. I believe if you can follow these basic tenets you will attain any type of physical fitenss you wish to. You could achieve a body for powerlifting, running, swimming, bodybuilding, fighting, etc. Whatever type of body you wish to achieve, it is yours.</p>

    <P><strong>There are a number of great exercises out there that will help develop your body. I personally have a few favorites which I'll be going over below:</strong></P>
    
    
    <div id="title-box">
      <div>
        <p><strong>To begin with we have Squats.</strong> If you want to develop powerful legs, you squat. It can be a fairly daunting exercise, especially if you're getting into heavier weights, but I personally can't think of a better exercise to develop the legs. This exercise will develop your glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps. It is an absolutely essential exercise to have in your arsenal, in my opinion.</p>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Next, we have the Shoulder Press.</strong> This exercise is one of my favorite. I take great joy in pushing weight above my head for some reason. This exercise is focusing primarily on the deltoids, but also hits the triceps and chest.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div>
      <p><strong>This next exercise is a bodyweight exercise: The Pull-Up.</strong> This is perhaps the greatest way to develop the back. I have'nt found anything that seems to workout the back quite like a pullup. depending how you do the pullup you can work just about every facet of the back and teh arms get a pretty great workout too.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>As our last exercise we have Pushups.</strong> If you don't have exercise equipment(even if you do), this is a great exercise for the chest and arms. There's a reason it's so well known. True, it's very accessible, but it's also an incredibly effective way to develop aspects of your upper body.</p>
